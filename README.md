### The Program 

****** ONLY CONFIGURED FOR THE TESTING SUITE. 
The program uses the point class to create points in an arbitrary amount of dimensions. It then creates a doubly linked list using the cluster class. 

### Source files 
main.cpp Main driver program designed to run a testing suite. 
Cluster.h class declaration 
Cluster.cpp Implements cluster class and functions 
Point.h Contains class declaration 
Point.cpp Implementation of Point class. 
also has random test suite files. 


### Circumstances 
it ran on xCode using the g++ compiler. 198/204 but I think that's because my file structure was screwed up. Should work 204/204
